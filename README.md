# Landmine-Detection-Robot-Using-STM32F407 with GPS and GSM

A landmine detection robot using an STM32 microcontroller works by integrating sensors like ultrasonic sensor,and user interface interaction to detect landmine.
Developed Landmine Detection Robot capable of detecting landmine with the help of metal detector.
Utilized advanced concepts of C language, with STM32F407 Board, and GSM module, GPS module and electronics sensors, and motor driver.Using the multiple concept of the Firmware programming.
It is built on the STM32F407 microcontroller platform and used the motor driver module (handle the wheels), ADC (communicate with sensor and timer), UART (communicate with the ADC and GSM module), GPS (send the location GSM)
